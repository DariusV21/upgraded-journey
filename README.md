Yeah, this is repository i guess...


This is repository for my interstellar Arduino + ST7735 TFT LCD + Python project.

So far it gets Bitcoin data from GDAX exchange, and shows it realtime on screen.
Also shows price alteration in percentage for the last 24 hours.

The Python uses gdax, time, os and serial libraries.
